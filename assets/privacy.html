        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>b. Listing and Selling</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Listing Description and Pricing</strong>: By listing an item on the App the retailer warrant that
            they and all aspects of the item comply with Kiranawala's published policies. Retailers also warrant that
            they
            may legally sell the item. Listed items represent a binding offer at the set price to other users who comply
            with the conditions specified in the offer. The contract of purchase is formed when a member complies with
            the conditions specified in the offer and completes the checkout process. Retailers must accurately describe
            their item and all terms of sale in the Kiranawala App or website. Retailers agree to provide, maintain and
            update the data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete information about themselves as prompted by
            Kiranawala's registration form, profile generation and shop set-up.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The listings by the Retailer may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content
            relevant to the sale of that item. All items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate
            tags. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing. Retailer
            must ensure that the listed items do not infringe upon the intellectual property, trade secrets or other
            proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy rights of third parties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All listed items must be kept in stock for successful fulfillment of sales.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the item description does not match the actual condition of the item, Retailer agrees to refund any
            amounts that they may have received from the buyer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Retailer
            may not alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding Kiranawala's transaction fees,
            misrepresent the item's location, or use another user's account without permission. The retailer’s items
            prices must be inclusive of applicable taxes. Kiranawala reserves the right to remove content which is
            deemed
            to be inappropriate or that could subject Kiranawala to legal action.</p>

        <p><strong>Sales:</strong> All sales are binding. The retailer is obligated to ship the order or otherwise
            complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner. The transaction between buyer and retailer shall
            be considered a legally binding contract between those two parties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

            offered through the Service or as otherwise explicitly provided by Kiranawala. The amount of credits that
            may
            be earned and other conditions for earning Credits shall be subject to the applicable campaign rules
            provided by Kiranawala. To the extent permitted by law, Kiranawala may change the rules at any time, and may
            terminate the entire credits system without any refund or other compensation for existing credits. "Credits"
            means credits that can be used solely to purchase eligible products through the Service in accordance with
            these Terms. A user will not be able to exchange credits for cash, property, or any other economic benefits
            other than for the purchase of eligible products through the Service that are specified by Kiranawala. A
            user
            will not be able to transfer credits to any other user or person.</p>

            We do not store the location of your device. Upon user's agreement we may collect names of individuals and
            companies that appear in your address book in order to improve voice recognition quality for requests
            related to this information. We do not collect any other information associated with these names such as
            addresses or phone numbers. Likewise, we may collect names from content on the device such as application
            names, artist names, titles and tags of the media files.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We collect information that you speak or type into a Kiranawala dialog box. We do not use the information we
            collect from you to identify you as an individual. Kiranawala never stores or keeps personally identifiable
            information on any user. We do collect personal information to improve the Services as described in this
            section.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>What do we use your information for?</h3>
        <p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:</p>
        <p>⎯&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To improve customer service: Buyer’s information helps us more effectively respond
            to the customer service requests and support needs.</p>
        <p>⎯&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To send periodic emails: We may use your email address to ask for feedback or
            inform you of product news and opportunities. In any such communication we will always provide a method to
            opt out of future communications.</p>
        <p>⎯&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To personalize your experience: Your information helps us to better respond to your
            individual needs.</p>
        <p>⎯&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To offer you better choices based on your geographical location E.g., when you ask
            Kiranawala Assistant to find a good dress or that footwear you were looking for, the Assistant needs to know
            where you are at the moment.</p>
        <p>⎯&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services and develop new ones.
            Buyer’s feedbacks always inspire us to improve our services</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Do we use cookies?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a website or its service provider transfers to your computer hard drive
            through the Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your
            browser and capture and remember certain information.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about
            website traffic and website interaction so that we can offer better website experiences and tools in the
            future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our website
            visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to
            help us conduct and improve our business.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.
            This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business,
            or servicing, as long as you give us your consent to transfer your personally identifiable information to
            outside parties and so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also
            release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our website
            policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable user
            information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. For example, when
            you ask Kiranawala Assistant to update your Facebook status, we provide Facebook with the information you
            gave
            us in order to fulfill your request. Information collected by the third-party applications provider is
            governed by their privacy policies.</p>

            kiranawaley@gmail.com) so that we could try to resolve the problem. We will make every reasonable
            attempt to resolve any issues you may have with the Kiranawala Services. Although you should keep in mind
            that

            Kiranawala may have no power to resolve such problem.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Lawful Purpose</h3>
        <p>You may use the Services only for lawful purposes. You are responsible for compliance with all federal,

            characters, explicit sexual content, sex crimes, disparagement of ethnic or religious groups, racial
            epithets, profane language or hate speech.</p>

        <p>Usage of the Kiranawala applications while driving or performing any other potentially dangerous activity
            which
            requires your attention may be distracting and unsafe for you and other people on the road, and is
            discouraged. Usage of the Services that involves typing on or looking at the device while driving or

        <h3>Voluntary Submissions to Kiranawala</h3>
        <p>If you are using Kiranawala Services on a platform with the ability to select a "Send Feedback" (or similar)
            option, you acknowledge that any submission that you make to us from Kiranawala's "Send Feedback" feature
            becomes the property of Kiranawala, including all intellectual property rights therein. By using this
            feature,
            you agree to assign upon transmission to Kiranawala all rights, title and interest (including all
            intellectual
            property rights therein) in such submission, and Kiranawala may use such submission in any way and for any
            purpose. However, we will not use your name or any other personal information without obtaining your express
            permission in advance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You agree not to submit any information or materials which would subject Kiranawala to any licenses or
            obligations if we were to use them. By sending us a submission, you are representing that you are the sole
            and rightful owner of the submission, and that to the best of your knowledge, no other third parties have
            any claim to your submission.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This section shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions as defined below.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Third Party Applications and content</h3>
        <p>In order to deliver the Services to you, Kiranawala invokes a number of third-party applications which were
            not
            developed by Kiranawala, i.e. browser, email and SMS programs, dialer, calendar, and other applications. The
            Services send information that you speak to these applications but do not perform these functions.
            Kiranawala
            cannot take responsibility for any functionality, content, suitability, privacy, support or other attribute
            of those applications or the content they may request from or deliver to you. Your use of those
            applications, including when you access them via the Services, is governed by any license agreements you may
            have entered into with their respective vendors.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We cannot guarantee that web searches or other queries you submit via the Services to other applications will
            not result in displaying content or links to content that you may find objectionable, offensive, or
            otherwise inappropriate. Such content is not within our control.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Third party links</h3>
        <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services through our website
            and other services. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore
            have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sit</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Fees, Costs, and Other Expenses</h3>
        <p>The Services make use of a data network operated by the device manufacturer and/or your wireless service
            provider to send both data and recorded audio from your device to our servers, and to serve information back
            to you. Depending on your data plan, you may incur charges from the device manufacturer or your wireless
            service provider for use of their networks and/or for specific services such as making phone calls, sending
            or receiving text messages and/or emails, or other services.</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for any and all costs you incur as a result of your usage of the Services.</p>
        <h3><strong>Delivery T&amp;Cs:</strong></h3>
        <p>You may not be able to avail our services if your delivery location is outside our current scope of service.
            We will keep you informed of the same at the time of confirming your order.</p>
        <p>You understand the delivery periods quoted to you at the time of confirming the order is an approximate
            estimate and may vary. We will not be responsible for any delay in the delivery of your order.</p>
        <p>Your order will be delivered only to the address designated by you at the time of placing the order on the
            platform. We reserve the right to cancel the order, in our sole discretion, in the event of any change to
            the place of delivery and you shall not be entitled to any refund for the same. Delivery in the event of
            change of the delivery location shall be at our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>You shall undertake to provide adequate directions, information, and authorisations to accept delivery. In
            the event of any failure to accept delivery, failure to deliver within the estimated time due to your
            failure to provide appropriate instructions, or authorisations, then such goods shall be deemed to have been
            delivered to you and all risk and responsibility in relation to such goods shall pass to you and you shall
            not be entitled to any refund for the same. Our decision in relation to this shall be final and binding.</p>
        <p>You understand that our liability ends once your order has been delivered to you.</p>

                When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
                under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy
                Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
                Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the

                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy

                significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
                globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
                they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various

                This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable
                rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
                courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
                non-compliance by data processors.
